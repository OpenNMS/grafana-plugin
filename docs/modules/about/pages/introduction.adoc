= What is {page-component-title}?

{page-component-title} is an application that lets users create flexible dashboards to interact with data stored by OpenNMS.
{page-component-title} works with https://grafana.com[Grafana], an analytics platform, to display and customize xref:fault[fault management (FM)] and xref:performance[performance management (PM)] data from https://www.opennms.org[OpenNMS Horizon] and https://www.opennms.com[OpenNMS Meridian].
Create and customize dashboards to display the data you want to see—alarms, outages, key performance indicators—in a way that best meets your organization's needs.

== How does it work?

{page-component-title} includes datasources for retrieving both FM and PM data from an existing OpenNMS deployment as well as specialized panels to display and interact with the faults.
The ability to aggregate data from multiple instances of OpenNMS lets operators build a single pane of glass from distributed deployments.

All interactions with OpenNMS are done via the REST API.
No FM or PM data is stored within {page-component-title} or Grafana.

[[fault]]
== Fault management

Fault management (FM) is the process of identifying problems (or faults) related to network devices and systems, and managing their lifecycle.
OpenNMS uses a combination of events, outages, alarms, and notifications to do this.

{page-component-title} supports filtering, retrieving, displaying, and performing actions against alarms in OpenNMS.

[[performance]]
== Performance management

Performance management (PM) is the process of gathering, storing, and analyzing system health using a series of metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs).
These metrics can be used for historical analysis or to automatically generate faults when certain conditions or thresholds are met.

{page-component-title} can retrieve and visualize metric data (measurements) that OpenNMS stores.
