= Development

== Codebase

Development is done in the https://github.com/opennms/opennms-helm/tree/develop[`develop`] (default GitHub) branch.

Commits to the `develop` branch are automatically compiled, tested, and merged to the https://github.com/opennms/opennms-helm/tree/develop[`master`] branch.

Releases will be tagged from the `master` branch and submitted to the https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-repository[Grafana plugin repository].

== Setting Up Helm and Grafana for development

1. Install https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js] and https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/[Grafana] for your platform.

2. Configure Grafana to allow unsigned plugin development by editing `grafana.ini`:
+
[source, ini]
----
app_mode = development
# further down in the file:
[plugins]
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = opennms-helm-app
----

3. Check out the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-helm[Helm git repository]:
+
[source, console]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-helm.git
cd opennms-helm
----

4. Build Helm and symlink the `dist` directory in your Helm source tree into the Grafana plugin path (you will need to change these paths to match your system).
+
[source, console]
----
# install Helm's build and runtime dependencies
npm ci
# do a one-time build to prime the dist/ directory
npm run dev
# symlink the dist/ directory into Grafana's plugin dir
ln -s /path/to/opennms-helm/dist /var/lib/grafana/plugins/opennms-helm-app
# run a continuous build that watches for changes
# after you save a change to Helm, just refresh Grafana to get the updates
npm run watch
----
