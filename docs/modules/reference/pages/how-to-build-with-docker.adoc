= Build with Docker

== Simple build

Helm can be compiled from source with a Docker build image.

[source, console]
----
docker build -t myopennmshelmimage .
----

will checkout the source from GitHub URL of the project, compile and installs the plugin.
The result is a runnable image which can be executed with

[source, console]
----
docker run -p 3000:3000 -t myopennmshelmimage
----

Log in on `\http://your-ip:3000` with login admin:admin and go to Plugins and enable the Helm app.

IMPORTANT: The plugin directory location is changed from `/var/lib/grafana/plugins` to `/opt/grafana/plugins` because the base grafana image defines the `/var/lib/grafana` as a _VOLUME_ which can't be changed.

== Advanced build

If you want to build an image based on a specific GitHub fork or branch you can use `--build-arg`:

[source, console]
----
docker build -t mycustomforkbranch \
            --build-arg OPENNMS_HELM_GIT_URL=https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-helm.git \
            --build-arg OPENNMS_HELM_GIT_BRANCH_REF=myBranch
----

This will create the plugin from the given GitHub URL and branch.

== Use Docker Compose to build a service stack

There is an example `docker-compose.yml` which builds a whole service stack with a compiled _Grafana OpenNMS Helm App_ which can be tested.

Modify the build arguments in the `docker-compose.yml` if you want to build from a GitHub fork, branch or version tag.

When you first run `docker-compose up -d`, the Grafana OpenNMS Helm plugin will be compiled from source.
Any run will use the compiled image from on the local system.
If you want to rebuild the image run `docker-compose build --no-cache` to rebuild the image with the build configuration in the given `docker-compose.yml`.

The URL for the data source in Grafana for the OpenNMS Horizon or Meridian server is `\http://opennms:8980/opennms`.

== Docker configuration for PDF dashboard reports

OpenNMS Horizon and Meridian include three templates to create a PDF report from an existing Grafana dashboard (see "Creating a PDF of a Grafana Dashboard" in the Horizon or Meridian documentation).
If you plan to use this feature and are running Helm with Docker, you must complete additional configuration.

Refer to Grafana's https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/image_rendering/#remote-rendering-service[remote rendering service documentation] for more information on how to set up remote rendering.
Additional details are available on https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/blob/master/docs/remote_rendering_using_docker.md[GitHub].
