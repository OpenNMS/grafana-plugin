= Basic walk-through

This section demonstrates how to create a simple dashboard with {page-component-title}:

* xref:bw-app-setup[set up the application and custom actions]
* xref:bw-ds-setup[set up datasources]
* xref:bw-dash-setup[create a dashboard]
* xref:bw-panel-create[create a panel]


The walk-through assumes that you have:

* an instance of Grafana with the {page-component-title} application installed
* an instance of OpenNMS that is reachable from the Grafana instance above
* one or more nodes being monitored by OpenNMS

If you already use the OpenNMS Data Source plugin with Grafana, see xref:migrating_from_opennms_datasource.adoc#[Migrate from the OpenNMS data source plugin] to for information on how to switch to {page-component-title}. 

[[bw-app-setup]]
== Setup plugin

In this section, you will enable the {page-component-title} plugin in Grafana and create <<Custom actions>> to help with alarm diagnosis. 

. Navigate to the home page of your Grafana instance.
. In the left menu, click the Configuration icon, and click *Plugins*:
+
image::gf-plugins.png[Plugins, 100]

. Search for the OpenNMS Helm plugin and click on it.

+
If the OpenNMS Helm plugin is not listed, try restarting the Grafana server.
If the issue persists, make sure the plugin is in the grafana plugins directory (default is var/lib/grafana/plugins).

. In the Config tab, click *Enable*.
+

A *Disable* button indicates the plugin is already enabled. 
Skip to the next step (creating <<Custom actions>>). 
You may also choose *Update* for the latest version of {page-component-title}. 

=== Custom actions

A custom action is a user-defined operation, such as a link to a node detail page or a Wiki knowledgebase article, that might help users better diagnosis an alarm. 
Once created, custom actions appear when you right-click an alarm in an alarms table:

image::gf-cust-action-context.png[Custom Actions, 300]

Created in the Helm Config tab, a custom action includes a label and URL.  
Custom action URLs may contain `$variables` that reference properties of an OpenNMS alarm.
See https://docs.opennms.com/opennms-js/2.1.0/index.html[OpenNMS.js documentation] for a list of available properties.

[NOTE]
====
Special case: you can access event parameters on the alarm either by index ($parameters[1]) or by name ($parameters[reason]).
====

If a variable cannot be matched against the row, the action will not appear in the context menu.
Variables are URL-encoded when injected into the URL.

.Action URLs using parameters
image::gf-custom-actions.png[Custom Actions, 500]

To create a custom action, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the home page of your Grafana instance.
. In the left menu, click on the Configuration icon and click *Plugins*:
. Select *OpenNMS Helm*. 
. On the Config tab, click *Add Custom Action*:
. Specify a label and enter a URL.
.. In most cases the URL will be your OpenNMS instance, for example, `http://localhost:8980/opennms/`, appended with the $variable that references a property of an OpenNMS alarm.
. Repeat for each custom action you want to create.
. Click *Update*. 

[[bw-ds-setup]]
== Datasource setup

The type of data you can display in your dashboard depends on the datasource you select. 
Before you create a dashboard, you need to set up the datasource. 
OpenNMS datasources include performance, flow, and entity. 
For more information on OpenNMS datasources, see  xref:datasources:performance_datasource.adoc[Datasources].

In this section, you will configure the Entity datasource.
Follow the same process to configure a Flow or Performance datasource. 
The only fields you *need* to configure are the following: URL, Basic auth, and Basic Auth Details (user and password).
Refer to Grafana's https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/[documentation] for information on configuring the other fields.  

. Navigate to the home page of your Grafana instance.
. In the left menu, click on the Configuration icon, and click *Data Sources*:
+
image::gf-data-sources.png[Data Sources, 100]

. Click *Add data source*.

. In the search field enter *OpenNMS Entities*.

. Beside the OpenNMS Entities datasource, click *Select*.
+
The settings screen appears:

image::gf-data-config.png[settings screen, 300]

. In the *URL* field, enter the URL to your OpenNMS instance, for example `http://localhost:8980/opennms`.

+
The URL to your OpenNMS instance should normally end with `/opennms`.

. In the *Auth* area, click the toggle next to *Basic Auth*.

. Enter the credentials for an OpenNMS user in the *User* and *Password* fields.

. Click *Save & Test*.
+
A success message should appear. 
If the message indicates a failure, review the information you entered and click *Save & Test* to retest the datasource.

[[bw-dash-setup]]
== Dashboard Setup

This section describes how to create a dashboard with an alarm table. 
For information on displaying additional or different types of data, see xref:bw-panel-create[creating a panel].

. Create a new dashboard by clicking the *+* sign in the left menu and chooosing *Create>Dashboard*.

. Click *Add new panel*.

+
A screen similar to the following appears. 
Configure the panel in the lower half of the screen:

+
image::gf-panel-config.png[Configure Panel, 500]

. In the *Query* drop-down, select the datasource we previously created in xref:bw-ds-setup[Datasource Setup].

. Select *Alarms* in the *SELECT* drop-down.
+
.. Configure addtional information and add filters as desired (click *+Query* to add queries). 

. In the *Panel* tab, under the *Settings>Panel title* add a name for the panel. 

. Under *Visualization*, select *Alarm Table*. 
The graph appears in the top of the panel.
+
.. You can further customize the graph by specifying information in the *Panel* tab. 

. In the top-right menu, click *Save*. 
. Enter a name for the dashboard and click *Save*.

That's it!
Now, you have your first dashboard.

Try changing the time range at the top right of the screen, or right click on an alarm row to perform actions against an alarm. 

Create more panels to display other data, or xref:importing.adoc#gs-dashboard-import[import] an existing dashboard to learn more about how to design your own. 

[[bw-panel-create]]
== Create a Panel
A panel is the part of your dashboard that displays the fault and performance management data you specify. 
Before you add a panel, determine the type of data you want to display (performance, metrics, alarms/nodes), and make sure that you have xref:bw-ds-setup[set up the associated datasource].
Default graph types in Grafana work only with the appropriate data source (for example, an alarm table visualization will not display data if a flow datasource is specified.)

. In your dashboard, click the `Add panel` icon and *Add new panel*.

. In the *Query* drop-down, select the datasource.

. Configure additional information as appropriate. 
Options are dependent on the type of datasource selected. 

. In the *Visualization* area of the panel tab, click the visualization icon. 
. Click *Graph* or select another type of visualization (Stat, Gauge, Bar gauge).
+
The graph appears in the top of the panel.

.. Specify information in the bottom half of the panel to customize the graph. 
. In *Panel* tab, change the name of the panel and specify additional information. 

. In the top-right, click the *Save*. 

[[bw-alarm-panel]]
== Create an Alarm Panel
An alarm panel displays alarms from an xref:datasources:entity_datasource.adoc#[entities datasource]. 
Visualization of entity datasource information (currently nodes and alarms) is normally done in tables. 

This procedure creates an alarm panel using an alarm table visualization. 

. In your dashboard, click the `Add panel` icon  icon and *Add new panel*.

. In the *Query* drop-down, select an entity datasource.

. From *SELECT*, choose `Alarms`. 

. Create filters and conditions to specify the nodes/alarms to display:
.. Note that you can use nested "and/or" logic.
.. You can order by ascending (oldest alarms first) or descending (most recent alarms) and limit the number of alarms displayed.
.. Toggle featured attributes on to display select attributes. 
Toggle it off to display all attributes in the drop-down lists. 

+
.Sample alarm table configuration
image::gf-alarm-table.png[Alarm table, 500]

. In the *Visualization* area of the panel tab, click the visualization icon. 
. Select and *Alarm Table* graph.
.. With alarms, you can also choose `Table` or `Alarm histogram`; with nodes, choose `Table` 
.. The graph appears in the top of the panel.
.. You can further customize the graph by (including alarm severity theme colors) in the bottom half of the screen and in other sections of the Panel tab. 
. Change the name of the panel. 
. In the top-right menu, click *Save*.
