= Flow Deep-Dive dashboard

The {page-component-title} plugin includes a pre-designed flow deep-dive dashboard that displays flow data.  
Access this dashboard from the home page or from the *Dashboards>Manage* menu. 
The dashboard can help with quality of service (QoS) monitoring and includes panels that display data in the following categories:

* flow interface statistics (throughput and data use by application)
* SNMP interface statistics (interface throughput and errors/discards)
* conversations (throughput and data use by conversation)
* hosts (throughput and data use by host)
* DCSPs (throughput and data use by Differentiated Services Code Points)

== QoS options

The dashboard exposes nodes and interfaces with flows, that you can filter on in the *Node* and *Interface* drop-down lists.  

You can also filter flows traffic by ToS/DSCP for nodes and interfaces with these values. 

Select a DSCP value (or combination of values) from the list for the QoS you want to visualize (class selector, IP precedence, assured forwarding, expedited forwarding). 

The ECN (explicit congestion notification) column of summary tables shows ECN-related information separated by a slash.
The first value shows if all summarized flows used ECN capable transports, abbreviated by `ect`, or at least one flow used a `non-ect`.
The second value indicates if a congestion was encountered (`ce`) or not (`no ce`).
This works for aggregated and unaggregated flow data. 

[[deep-dive-configure]]
== Configure a Flow Deep-Dive dashboard

By default, the Flow Deep-Dive dashboard uses the OpenNMS Flow and OpenNMS Performance data sources. 
If you have not already specified these data sources, follow the instructions in xref:basic_walkthrough.acod#bw-ds-setup[set up datasources] to do so. 

You can further configure the dashboard by creating queries or editing existing panels. 
For more information, see xref:panel_configuration:index.adoc#pc-index[Panel Configuration].

IMPORTANT: Use "Save As" to create your custom version of the Flow Deep-Dive dashboard. 
Otherwise, changes you make to the default dashboard are overwritten when you update the plugin or re-import the dashboard.
