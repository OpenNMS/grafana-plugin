= Performance Datasource

You can use the Performance datasource to retrieve performance metrics (for example, data collection and response time metrics) from the OpenNMS Measurements API.
For an example of the Performance datasource in use, see <<panel_configuration:dynamic-dashboard.adoc#pc-template-filters, Use variables to create dynamic dashboards>>.

== Query editor

This section lists the types of queries that you can build using the query editor.

=== Attribute queries

Attribute queries are used to extract data points from the time series data that OpenNMS collects and stores.
You can specify which attributes or series to query.

[caption=]
.Attribute query options
[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Field Name  | Description | Allowed Filter Expressions

| Node
| The node ID or `FS:FID` (foreign source and foreign ID tuple) of the node to query.
Can also be a variable with a `nodeFilter()` query.
| _None_

| Resource ^1^
| The resource ID that contains the requested attribute.
Can also be a variable with a `nodeResources()` query.
| `*` , `\|`

| Attribute ^1^
| Name of the attribute to query.
| `*` , `\|`

| Sub-Attribute
| Name of the sub-attribute to query.
Can be used to query metrics which are modeled using many datasources in a single RRD file (for example, `StrafePing`).
| _None_

| Fallback Attribute
| Name of the attribute to query if the requested attribute is not available.
| _None_

| Aggregation
| RRD aggregation to use when exporting metrics (`Average`, `Min`, `Max`, `Last`).
Defaults to `Average`.
| _None_

| Label
| Name for the series.
Must be unique for all attributes and expression results in the query.
| _None_
|===

. The Resource and Attribute fields allow the `*` (match any text) and `|` (match the expression to the left or right of the character) filter characters.
With them, you can create search patterns that let you retrieve multiple resources and attributes using a single query.

Given the following resources, the table below shows an example of possible filter expressions:

* `interfaceSnmp[eth0-00e08177b841]`
* `interfaceSnmp[Default-0001d7709c83]`
* `interfaceSnmp[HR_VLAN-0001d7709c87]`
* `interfaceSnmp[Facilities_VLAN-0001d7709c85]`

=== String property queries

String property queries are used to read the last value of string-valued properties that OpenNMS collects and stores.
You can specify which string property to query.

A panel can contain multiple string property queries, and their results can be visualized in a table.
You can use Grafana's transforms ("Filter by Name," "Organize Fields," or "Merge") to adjust the tables as desired.

[caption=]
.String property query options

Can also be a variable with a `nodeFilter()` query.

| Resource
| The resource ID that contains the requested attribute.
Can also be a variable with a `nodeResources()` query.

| String Property
| Name of the attribute to query.
|===

=== Expression queries

Expression queries are used to combine or otherwise transform one or more series into a new series.
They support the mathematical and conditional operators that JEXL provides.
Expression queries are sent over the https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/development/rest/measurements.html#more-advanced-expressions[OpenNMS Measurements API] to be processed server-side.

== Variable queries

You can use variable queries in metric queries and panel titles.
The results will appear as a drop-down list at the top of the dashboard; you can select from the list to change the data that the associated panel displays.
For an example of a variable query, see <<panel_configuration:dynamic-dashboard.adoc#pc-template-filters, Use variables to create dynamic dashboards>>.

=== locations()

The `locations()` query returns a list of all available node locations.
You can use this inside a `nodeFilter()` query to filter the number of nodes displayed by location.

.Example expressions using `nodeFilter()`
[source,]
----
nodeFilter(location='Default')
nodeFilter(location='$location') <1>
----
<1> This example assumes you have a `location` variable with a `locations()` query.

=== nodeFilter(<filterQuery>)

The `nodeFilter()` query returns a list of nodes which match the given filter expression.

.Example expressions using `nodeFilter()`
[source,]
----
nodeFilter(catincProduction & catincLinux) <1>
nodeFilter(location='Default' & catincProduction & catincSNMP) <2>
nodeFilter() <3>
----
<1> Returns the set of nodes that are in the `Production` and `Linux` categories.
<2> Returns the set of nodes that are in the `SNMP` and `Production` categories and the `Default` location.
<3> Returns all nodes in inventory.

Only one argument is available for the `nodeFilter()` query:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Argument  | Description

| filterQuery
| Any valid node query syntax as used by core OpenNMS services (see the https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/reference/configuration/filters/filters.html[OpenNMS Filters documentation]).
If omitted, all nodes are returned.
|===

=== nodeResources(<nodeId>[,textProperty[,resourceType[,regexFilter]]])

The `nodeResources()` query returns a list of resource IDs that are available on the specified node.
An optional second argument specifies whether to display the resource's ID, its label, or its name in the template value selector and elsewhere.
By default, the query displays the resource's ID.
An optional third argument specifies an exact `resource-type` name (for example, `interfaceSnmp`).
Passing a wildcard (`*`) allows for resources of all types to be returned.

You can use regular expressions in the variable query to filter which resource IDs are used.

.Examples of `nodeResources()` queries
[source,]
----
nodeResources(123) <1>
nodeResources(FS:FID) <2>
nodeResources(42, label, interfaceSnmp) <3>
nodeResources(42, label, *, .*DPN.*) <4>
nodeResources($node) <5>
----
<1> Queries a specific node by its ID (`123`).
<2> Queries a specific node by its foreign source and foreign ID, formatted as a tuple.
<3> Queries node ID `42` for only SNMP interface resources.
The result displays the interface's resource labels rather than their IDs.
<4> Queries node ID `42` for all resources and returns items whose labels match the regular expression `\*.DPN.*`.
<5> Queries for all resources on the node returned from a `nodeFilter()` query.
When requesting resources from a node based on another variable, the node variable should return only a single node.

The following arguments are available for the `nodeResources()` query:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Argument  | Description | Default Value

3+|*Required*

| nodeId
| The node (identified either by its `databaseId` or `foreignSource:foreignId` tuple) to display resources from.
| _Blank_

3+|*Optional*

| textProperty
| Sets alternate string values (`id`, `label`, or `name`) in the variable drop-down list.
| id

| resourceType
| Filter to limit the types of resources returned by the query.
| `*`

| regexFilter
| Regular expression filter applied to the value of the field specified by `textProperty`.
| `.*`
|===

== Label formatters

{page-component-title} provides a number of formatting functions that you can use to transform the labels displayed in graph legends.
You can use one or more of them to transform the labels based on node or resource metadata returned from OpenNMS (requires Horizon 24 or newer).

=== nodeToLabel(<nodeCriteria>)

The `nodeToLabel()` function replaces the specified node's ID with its label.
You can specify either a node ID or a `foreignSource:foreignId` tuple.
You can also use a template variable based on a custom list of node identifiers, or the results of a `nodeFilter()` query.

.Examples of `nodeToLabel()` functions
[source,]
----
nodeToLabel($node) <1>
nodeToLabel(123) <2>
nodeToLabel(FS:FID) <2>
----
<1> Queries a template variable that represents a list of node identifiers.
<2> Queries specific nodes using their IDs or `foreignSource:foreignId` tuples.

=== resourceToLabel(<resourceId or nodeCriteria>[, <partialResourceId>])

The `resourceToLabel()` function converts an OpenNMS resource identifier, or a node criteria and partial identifier, into that resource's label.
The format of the resource's label depends on the resource type and can be anything from a node label to a descriptive string for an IP interface.

The single-argument form of this function expects a complete resource ID.
That resource ID must be the full resource identifier as queried to the OpenNMS Measurements API.
The two-argument form of this function lets you use template variables to specify a node and separately provide the remainder of the resource ID that you want to translate.

A partial resource ID is the portion of the resource identifier that does not identify the node itself (for example, `nodeSnmp[]`, `responseTime[127.0.0.1]`).
For example, all of these calls translate into the same text:

[source,]
----
resourceToLabel(node[FS:FID].nodeSnmp[])
resourceToLabel(FS:FID, nodeSnmp[])
resourceToLabel($node, $interface) <1>
----
<1> Assumes that the `$node` variable is populated with a value from a `nodeFilter()` query, and the `$interface` variable is populated with a value from a `nodeResources()` query.

=== resourceToName(<resourceId or nodeCriteria>[, <partialResourceId>])

The `resourceToName()` function behaves similarly to `resourceToLabel()`, but it returns the resource's name rather than its label.
The resource name is usually the resource's internal, machine-readable name (for example, a node criteria or an interface name and MAC address).

.Examples of `resourceToName()` functions
[source,]
----
resourceToName(node[FS:FID].nodeSnmp[])
resourceToName(FS:FID, nodeSnmp[])
resourceToName($node, $interface) <1>
----
<1> Assumes that the `$node` variable is populated with a value from a `nodeFilter()` query, and the `$interface` variable is populated with a value from a `nodeResources()` query.

=== resourceToInterface(<resourceId or nodeCriteria>[, <partialResourceId>])

The `resourceToInterface()` function transforms a resource ID, or a combination of node criteria and a partial resource ID, into another value.
It is a special case of the other, more general methods; it takes the label of the resource (assumed to be an `interface-MAC` formatted string) and returns the interface portion of the label.
