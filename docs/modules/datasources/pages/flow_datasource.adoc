= Flow Datasource

== General

Use the flow datasource to retrieve application- and conversation-related metrics derived from flow data stored by OpenNMS.

The query editor supports the following functions:

[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Category  | Name                    | Description
| Combine   | `topN`                  | Limit the results to the Top N conversations/applications when sorted by total bytes.
| Combine   | `includeOther`          | Combine and include other conversations/applications that fall outside of the Top N.
| Filter    | `withExporterNode`      | Filter for flows related to the given exporter node.
| Filter    | `withIfIndex`           | Filter for flows related to the given interface index.
| Filter    | `withDscp`              | Filter for flows with the given DSCP value(s).
| Filter    | `withApplication`       | Filter for flows with the given application value(s). Use without `topN`.
| Filter    | `withConversation`      | Filter for flows with the given conversation value(s). Use without `topN`.
| Filter    | `withHost`              | Filter for flows with the given host value(s). Use without `topN`.
| Transform | `toBits`                | Convert the values from bytes to bits.
| Transform | `perSecond`             | Convert the values to a per/second rate.
| Transform | `negativeEgress`        | Make the egress values negative.
| Transform | `negativeIngress`       | Make the ingress values negative.
| Transform | `asTableSummary`        | Generate a tabular summary instead of time series data.
| Transform | `combineIngressEgress`  | Sum ingress and egress values together.
| Transform | `onlyIngress`           | Only display ingress traffic.
| Transform | `onlyEgress`            | Only display egress traffic.
| Transform | `withGroupByInterval`   | Changes the resolution of the returned datapoints grouping by the given time interval (in the format of: 10s, 5m, 1h, etc.).
| Transform | `withPrefix`            | Specifies a prefix for graph and summary labels.
| Transform | `withSuffix`            | Specifies a suffix for graph and summary labels.
| Transform | `nanToZero`             | Convert all NaN values to zero (0) so they can be taken into consideration by reduce expressions like `sum` or `max`.

[[ds-flow-template]]
== Template queries

=== locations()

The `locations()` query returns a list of all available node locations.
Use this inside `exporterNodesWithFlows()` to filter the number of nodes displayed by location.

.Example variable expression
* exporterNodesWithFlows(location='Default')
* exporterNodesWithFlows(location='$location')

=== exporterNodesWithFlows(<filterQuery>)

The `exporterNodesWithFlows()` query returns a list of nodes which have exported flow data to OpenNMS.
The value of the template variable is the `Node ID` and the display text is the `Node Label`.

NOTE: The exporters must be part of the node inventory in OpenNMS in order to be returned by this query.

For example, to query the exporters that have sent flows you can use the following expression:
```
exporterNodesWithFlows()
```

The filter expression must be an existing node attribute and its corresponding value.
The value can be a constant or a variable.

.Example variable expression
* exporterNodesWithFlows(<node_attribute>='<value>')
* exporterNodesWithFlows(location='Default')
* exporterNodesWithFlows(location='$location')

=== interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(<nodeCriteria>)

The `interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows()` query returns a list of interface indexes which are associated with one or more flows on the given node.
The value of the template variable is the `Interface Index` and the display text is the `Interface Name`.

The available arguments are as follows:
[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Name                 | Default     | Description
| nodeCriteria         | `(none)`    | Node criteria (Node ID, or Node Foreign Source and Node Foreign ID) of the node on which to enumerate the interfaces.
|===

Assuming that the `$node` variable is populated with a value from the `exporterNodesWithFlows` query, you can use the following expression:
```
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows($node)
```

To query a specific node by id, you can use an expression similar to:
```
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(123)
```

To query a specific node by foreign source and foreign id, you can use an expression similar to:
```
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(FS:FID)
```

=== dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface(<nodeCriteria>,<interface>,<from>,<to>)

The `dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface()` query will return a list of DSCP values which are used by one or more flows on the given node and interface
and given time range. The query returns selection options for the found DSCP values and ip precedence groups that cover these values.
Labels of selection options for DSCP codes are symbolic names for these DSCP codes followed by the corresponding number (if applicable).

The available arguments are as follows:
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name                 | Default     | Description
| nodeCriteria         | `(none)`    | Node criteria (Node ID, or Node Foreign Source and Node Foreign ID) of the node on which to enumerate.
| interface            | `(none)`    | Interface Index of the SNMP interface to enumerate.
| from                 | `(none)`    | Start time in epoch milliseconds
| to                   | `(none)`    | End time in epoch milliseconds
|===

Assuming that the `$node` variable is populated with a value from the `exporterNodesWithFlows` query and that the `$interface` variable is populated with a value from the `interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows($node)` query, you can use the following expression:
```
dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface($node, $interface, $__from, $__to)
```

=== applications(<limit>)

The `aplications()` query returns a list of all available applications.
This function is intended for use inside the Filter function `withApplications()` as a template variable if needed.

Currently this function accepts an optional number of records which ensures that only a limited number or records will be retreieved.

NOTE: The application values retrieved come "as is" from the `flows/applications/enumerate` API.

.Examples: variable expression
* applications()
* applications(1000)

.Use with filter function withApplications()
* withApplications($applications)

=== conversations(<application>,<location>,<protocol>,<limit>)

The `conversations()` query returns a list of all available conversations.
This function is intended for use inside the filter function `withConversation()` as a template variable if needed.
Currently this function accepts the following arguments:

[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Position  | Argument                      | Description                               | Default

* conversations(app0, Default, http, 10)

Get all conversations with application that start with app under location that start with Def and protocols http and https.

* conversations(app.\*, Def.\*, http.*, 1000)

.Usage with filter function withConversation()
* withConversation($conversations)

NOTE: The conversations values retrieved come `as is` from `flows/conversations/enumerate` API.

=== hosts(<pattern>,<limit>)

The `hosts()` query returns a list of all available hosts.
This function is intended for use inside the filter function `withHost()` as a template variable if needed.
Currently this function accepts the following arguments:

[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Position  | Argument                      | Description                               | Default
| 1         | pattern (optional)            | host expression                           | ".*"
| last      | limit (optional)              | limit number of records retrieved        | 25
|===

.Examples: variable expression

Get all hosts (will return a maximum of 25 records).

* hosts()

Get all hosts and return a maximum of 10 records.

* hosts(10)

Get all hosts that match the pattern 192.168.0.* and return a maximum of 10 records.

* hosts(192.168.0.*, 10)
