# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A **Grafana App Plugin** (`type: "app"`) that integrates OpenNMS® Horizon™/Meridian™ with Grafana 12.x for monitoring dashboards. It includes 3 data sources, 5 custom panels, and bundled dashboards. The `opennms` npm library handles all REST API communication with OpenNMS.

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # One-time development build
npm run watch        # Watch mode (webpack -w)
npm run server       # Start Grafana via docker-compose

# Production
npm run build        # Production webpack build
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit)

# Testing
npm test             # Run all Jest tests
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode (changed files only)
npx jest src/test/react/function_formatter.spec.ts  # Single test file
npx jest --testNamePattern="parenthesize"           # Tests matching pattern

# Linting
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix ESLint issues

# E2E
npm run e2e          # Playwright tests
```

Tests live in `src/test/react/*.spec.ts`.

```

### OpenNMS Client Layer

Each datasource instantiates two request objects in its constructor:
- **`ClientDelegate`** (`src/lib/client_delegate.ts`) — wraps the `opennms.Client` with `Rest.GrafanaHTTP`, handles auth decoding, timeouts. Used for structured model queries (nodes, alarms, etc.)
- **`SimpleOpenNMSRequest`** (`src/lib/simpleRequest.ts`) — thin wrapper around `getBackendSrv()` for direct REST calls (flows, resources, etc.)

### Data Source Pattern

Each datasource (e.g., `perf-ds`) has:
- `*DataSource.ts` — extends `DataSourceApi`, implements `query()` and `testDatasource()`
- `*QueryEditor.tsx` — query builder UI
- `*ConfigEditor.tsx` — datasource settings UI
- `queries/` — query building logic separated from the datasource class
- `types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces for the datasource

### Filter Panel / Entity DS Cross-Panel State

The Filter Panel stores active filters in **localStorage**. The Entity DS reads these in `query()` via `loadFilterEditorData()` and merges them with the query's own filters using `mergeFilterPanelFilters()`. The dashboard UID is used as the storage key.

## Key Conventions

### Critical: `opennms` Model Objects and `toJSON()`

**Never** pass `OnmsNode[]`, `OnmsEnum`, or other `opennms` model objects directly to Grafana `SelectableValue` components. Grafana uses `json-source-map` to diff panel state; it expects `toJSON()` to return a `String`, but `opennms` models return objects — causing runtime `TypeError`.

Always convert to plain objects:
```typescript
const selectableValues = nodes.map(n => ({
  id: n.id,
  label: n.label,
  value: { id: n.id, label: n.label }
}))
```

### Config Extension Pattern

Do **not** modify files in `.config/`. Override at the root level:
- ESLint → `eslint.config.mjs`
- TypeScript → `tsconfig.json`
- Jest → `jest.config.js`
- Webpack → `webpack.config.ts` (merges with `.config/webpack/webpack.config`)

### Webpack: Help README Copying

`webpack.config.ts` copies `datasources/*/help-README.md` → `README.md` in `dist/`. The `help-README.md` files are the end-user-facing docs shown in Grafana's "?" tooltip; the top-level `README.md` is developer-facing.

### Jest: ESM Transform

The `opennms` package is ESM and must be included in the transform list:
```javascript
transformIgnorePatterns: [nodeModulesToTransform([...grafanaESModules, 'opennms'])]
```

### Security: `npm overrides`

Transitive dependency CVEs are fixed via `overrides` in `package.json`. To fix a new transient dep vulnerability, add an entry under `overrides`, then:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
osv-scanner -L package-lock.json
```

**Delete `node_modules` too, not just the lockfile.** Regenerating the lockfile alone leaves already-installed packages in place, so npm reuses them and the new overrides silently fail to take effect — you get a lockfile that does not match `overrides`.

When a package has two major lines live in the tree (e.g. `@xmldom/xmldom` 0.8 and 0.9), use npm's scoped key syntax so neither line is force-upgraded across a major:

```json
"@xmldom/xmldom@^0.8.0": "^0.8.13",
"@xmldom/xmldom@^0.9.0": "^0.9.10"
```

Scoped keys match on the *requested spec*, not the resolved version, so they do not work against an exact pin — `@grafana/ui` requires `uuid` as `"11.1.0"`, which no range key matches. Use a nested override under the parent in that case.

A full reinstall also re-resolves every `^` range, so it can surface breakage unrelated to the CVE work. Run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` afterwards — `npm run build` in particular is the only one that exercises `webpack.config.ts` through ts-node.

## CI/CD Notes

- CI runs `@grafana/plugin-validator` with `grafana-plugin-validator-config.yaml`
- `osv-scanner` checks CVEs in `package-lock.json`; to temporarily disable: set `osv-scanner.enabled: false` in the config yaml (revert before production builds)
- Build artifacts are RPM/DEB/ZIP via `npm run package:rpm|deb|zip`. Everything packaging
  lives under `scripts/` — `scripts/rpm/` (`make-rpm.js`, `spec.mustache`), `scripts/deb/`
  (`make-deb.js`, `debian/`), `scripts/zip/` (`make-zip.js`) — and is tested by
  `src/test/packaging/`. Packaging inputs must **not** move back under `src/`: webpack sweeps
  `src/` into `dist` and `npm run sign` attests everything in `dist`
- CI invokes the `npm run package:*` scripts, so entry-point paths are not hardcoded in
  `.circleci/config.yml`
- `MAKERPM_DEBUG=1` / `MAKEDEB_DEBUG=1` / `MAKEZIP_DEBUG=1` turn on verbose output for
  CircleCI debugging. Each entry point is a thin wrapper; the work lives in a sibling
  `build.js` that takes paths as arguments so it can be tested against a fixture `dist`
- CI executors: `make-rpm` runs on `rockylinux/rockylinux:9` and `make-deb` on
  `node:22-trixie`; `make-tarball`/`make-zip` need only node, `tar` and `zip` and run on
  `node-executor`. `opennms/build-env` is **not** an option any more — its newest
  RHEL-family tag is CentOS 8 with Node 16 and its newest Debian tag is bullseye with
  Node 18, both far below this repo's `engines` (`>=22 <25`). Neither image carries a
  JDK, because nothing in this pipeline uses Java
- `sign-packages/install-deb-dependencies` pins
  `-o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=sources.list -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=-`, and Debian 12+ ships
  its sources as deb822 in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources` with no
  `/etc/apt/sources.list` at all. On its own the orb step therefore refreshes nothing and
  fails with "Unable to locate package debsigs". `make-deb` runs a plain `apt-get update`
  first (it needs `debhelper` anyway); the orb passes `-o APT::Get::List-Cleanup=0`, so
  those lists survive into its own call. Do not drop that step
- `build-docs` runs on `node-executor` and takes Antora from this repo's own `@antora`
  devDependencies. There is deliberately no `docs-executor`: every `opennms/antora` tag,
  newest included, is Alpine 3.18 on **Node 16**, and Antora 3.2 requires Node >= 20, so
  that image cannot run current Antora at all. Do **not** reintroduce it. The symptom it
  produced was `diagChan.tracingChannel is not a function` out of `pino` — the CLI
  resolves `@antora/site-generator` from the playbook directory first, so the image's
  Node 16 loaded the repo's own copy and died in its `pino@10` (Node >= 20) dependency.
  Both the image bundle and the repo tree must therefore stay on the same Node
- `@antora/xref-validator` is **not** on npmjs.org — only a GitLab tarball — so it cannot
  be a devDependency. `npm run validate-xrefs` installs it itself, into `.antora-tools/`
  (gitignored) and pinned to a commit rather than `main`, which has not moved since 2022.
  `build-docs` just calls that script, so the pinned commit lives in exactly one place.
  Two flags in it are load-bearing:
  - `--omit=optional`: the validator declares `@antora/*` as `optionalDependencies` on a
    floating `^3.0.0-alpha.1` range, so installing them gives it a second Antora that can
    drift from the lockfile's. Omitted, its bare `require`s fall through to
    `./node_modules` and it validates with the same Antora that `npm run docs` generates
    with. Verified via `require.resolve`, not assumed
  - `--log-failure-level=error`: Antora's default `failure_level` is **`fatal`**, so a
    broken xref logs at `error` and still exits **0**. Without this the step reports
    problems and passes anyway. `npm run docs` has the same default and is deliberately
    left alone, so authoring locally is not blocked; `validate-xrefs` is the gate
- The docs UI bundle comes from `OpenNMS/antora-ui-opennms` (v3.1.1), matching
  `antora-playbook-local.yml` in the main OpenNMS repo. The old
  `opennms-forge/antora-ui-opennms` bundle is a different repo whose newest release is
  v3.1.0 from 2022. The bundle is only presentation assets — it has no bearing on the
  Node/Antora version problem above
- Rocky 9 ships neither `tar` nor `nodejs` and `rpm-build` does not pull `tar` in, so
  `make-rpm` installs `nodejs npm rpm-build tar` explicitly — the spec's `%setup` needs
  `tar`. The orb's `.rpmmacros` forces a bzip2 payload (`w0.bzdio`), which keeps the RPM
  installable on older rpm than el9's zstd default would
- The deb builds under the system temp directory, never under `artifacts/`.
  `dpkg-buildpackage` writes a `.dsc`, `.changes`, `.buildinfo` and source tarball beside the
  `.deb`, and only the `.deb` is signed and published; building in `artifacts/` shipped all of
  them to CI and left a full copy of `dist` there on failure. Each builder cleans its working
  tree in a `finally`, not on the success path only
- `make-rpm.js` renders `scripts/rpm/spec.mustache` itself. Do **not** reintroduce `speculate`: 6.x
  hardcodes its own systemd-service spec template and ignores `spec.specTemplate` /
  `spec.installDir`, which silently packaged the plugin into `/usr/lib` with a bogus service
  unit. `src/test/packaging/rpm_spec.spec.ts` guards against this
- The spec template must use triple-stache (`{{{ }}}`): mustache escapes `/` as `&#x2F;`,
  which would mangle every path in the spec
- `scripts/distContents.js` is the single list of what never belongs in a distributable. The
  scaffolded webpack config copies `src/**/*.json` into `dist` with no ignore list, which used
  to drag the jest fixtures under `src/test` into `dist/test`; `webpack.config.ts` now adds
  that list as a `CopyWebpackPlugin` ignore. This matters because `npm run sign` walks `dist`
  and writes a **signed** `MANIFEST.txt` — anything in `dist` gets attested, and stripping it
  at packaging time leaves the manifest declaring files the package does not contain, which
  fails `@grafana/plugin-validator`. Keep things out of `dist`; do not strip them later

## Support Matrix
